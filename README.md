# onedark-wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers colourised to fit the onedark gtk theme (some curated by myself)

The wallpapers featrured here have been found from a variety of sources including [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/), the [r/unixporn discord wallpapers channel](https://discord.gg/unixporn), this amazing [gruvbox collelction](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.onrender.com/), (the now deceased)[ catppuccin wallpaper repo](https://web.archive.org/web/20230215022523/https://github.com/catppuccin/wallpapers) (wayback machine link should work) and the fabulous [nordic-wallpapers repo](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers). A bunch of these wallpapers also came from various image dumps on imgur and have have been put through the onedark filter of [ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it/).
The images here are of at least 1920x1080 and above (some as large as 5K)

I plan on adding to this as time goes on as I belive this is the only active onedark wallpaper repo existing thus far (I have found [this older repo](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanNile/onedark-wallpapers)).

### If there are any wallpapers that their respectful creators which to be removed, please make an issue and I will remove them ASAP.
